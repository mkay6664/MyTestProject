      <p><span class="p-opener">New York |</span> Vegan food is trending. Over the past decade, Americans’ appetite for vegan and plant-based foods has sharpened. Revenue from the sale of vegan food and food products has grown 17% over the past 12 months, and will exceed 17% according to a recent study procured by Nielsen. </p>

      <p>Intellectuals and trend-setters in the U.S. such as Bill Gates and Michael Pollan have advocated for the reduction of meat consumption and other proteins. Eatin’ vegan is not only healthy for the body, but also for the environment. </p>

      <p>In the City, high quality restaurants with Michelin-star chefs and exclusively vegan menus have been established recently. In addition, burger joints and other casual restaurants such as White Castle, Wahlburgers, and Momofuku Nishi have offered vegan menu choices like the vegan Impossible Burger. </p>

      <p>NYC consumers are increasingly favoring plant-based goods. For example, Oatly experienced shortages last Summer. The smoked watermelon “ham” served by the Ducks Eatery in the East Village also went viral. </p>

      <p>Non-vegan chefs are employed by vegan restaurants such as Sans, where Champ Jones operates at the helm. There, Jones serves dishes such as tofu, and “meatloaf” if his patrons opt out of the five-course tasting menu.</p>

      <p>Vegandale, a food festival located in Randall’s Island in New York, sold tickets to over 15,000 customers. Eva Lampert, the director of operations for the festival, commented “that since 2014, the boom of veganism in media and pop culture has removed the taboo of veganism.” </p>
